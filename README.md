# SARCOIDOSIS-PATTERN
EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS OF SARCOIDOSIS ILD PATTERN FROM LUNG CT IMAGE


### DESCRIPTION 
Morphological changes are often associated with unwanted growth of tissues. Identifying and quantifying these changes have always used as first line of diagnosis. Most of the clinicians expressed cumbersome due to enormous amount of medical images and also poor quality of images during acquisition, limiting the correct diagnosis. Large range of lung patterns of disease can be observed from CT scan images. For clinical practices, images are accumulated and stored in digital representation from MRI, CT, Ultrasound etc., in PACS, processing and thereby for diagnosis. Medical image segmentation is an important step form resuccessive image analysis tasks. The goal of lung segmentation is to separate region of interest (ROI) for extracting lung abnormalities of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) patterns like Sarcoidosis, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Malignant nodules, and Sarcoidosis structures
